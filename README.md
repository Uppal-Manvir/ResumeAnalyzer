# AI-Powered Resume Analyzer

An AI-driven web application that analyzes resumes against job descriptions and provides match scores, missing skill feedback, and job recommendations.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Semantic Resume Scoring** ‚Äì Uses OpenAI embeddings (`text-embedding-3-small`) to compare resume content with job descriptions.
- **AI Feedback Generator** ‚Äì GPT-4 identifies missing skills, soft skills, and specific experience gaps based on job postings.
- **Automated Job Scraping** ‚Äì A Python + Selenium pipeline pulls job listings from the web, scores them, and stores results.
- **Scoring Dashboard** ‚Äì Backend-integrated job scoring with PostgreSQL storage and .NET Core API endpoints.
